# SAP-1_computer_using_Logisim
I have developed a SAP-1 computer on Logisim as one of my academic projects.
Here the Program Counter, Memory Address Register (MAR), Instruction Register (IR), Controller, Accumulator, Adder Subtractor, B Register, Output Register and Binary Display all of the components of the SAP-1 computer has been implemented from scratch. The built in 16*8 RAM of Logisim has been used as the required RAM for the SAP -1 computer.
The final circuit of the SAP-1 computer has been tested with different input output combinations.
